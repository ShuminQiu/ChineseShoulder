STEP1: generate a list of elite chemists 
First, we define a top chemistry journal list that includes 31 top journals (see appendix Table B2)(elite_chemistry_journals). 
Then, Based on the author disambiguation work of Torvik and Smalheiser (2009) and its update to the 2018 version of PubMed, we can generate an author-publication dataset that assigns each article to unique authors. 
Based on this dataset, we define the top chemists who published the top 1% of papers  during 2000-2019. 

STEP2: manually collect and code CVs for elite chemists, and finally generate 751 CVs for non-US chemistry PIs 
see file: full_chemists_CV.xlsx
  
STEP3: generate a dataset of PI's publications (PI are the last authors) for CEM matching
see file: PIpaper_new_4match.dta

STEP4: after matching, we need to create a citation risk set for the matched papers. 
  The citation risk set consists of potential citing papers that are topically-related articles published after the source. Some papers in the risk set are actual citations (atrisk =1) to the source paper, 
  and some do not cite the source paper.

Since GitHub has limitations on file size for uploads, we’re using Dropbox to share these datasets：
