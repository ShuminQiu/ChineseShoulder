#######ethnicity data 
# we map a scholarâ€™s last name to its ethnic origins based on the algorithm pioneered by Nguyen (2019). Based on her algorithm, we can generate a relationship between 
# last name and country, with the probability that  a last name corresponds to a particular ethnic origin 
## we load the data: surname_ethnic_prob_10_split that shows the xalks betweenlast name and country, with probability (value)
